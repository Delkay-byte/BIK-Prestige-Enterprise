**Purpose:** Help new users get started with the platform quickly and confidently.

## How Everyone Logs In (Unified Login)

All non-admin users now share **one** login page. You no longer need to remember
separate role-specific URLs.

- **Canonical login page:** `/login`
- **Administrator login (separate):** `/admin/login`

### The standard instruction

> **Go to the BIK Prestige login page and select who you are.**

| User type          | Choose on the login screen |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Customer           | 👤 **Customer**            |
| MoMo Agent         | 💰 **MoMo Agent**          |
| Susu Collector     | 🧑‍💼 **Susu Collector**    |
| Administrator      | Use the **separate administrator login** |

1. Open the BIK Prestige login page (`/login`).
2. Tap/click the card that matches **who you are**.
3. Enter your credentials in the form that appears.
4. You will land in your own dashboard.

> The role you select is only a *requested workspace*. The server checks it
> against your actual account capabilities, so a customer can never open a
> staff dashboard (and vice versa). If you pick a role you are not authorized
> for, sign-in is denied.

Legacy shortcuts still work and simply pre-select the role for you:
`/customer/login` → `/login?role=customer`,
`/login?role=momo` (MoMo Agent), `/login?role=susu` (Susu Collector).
